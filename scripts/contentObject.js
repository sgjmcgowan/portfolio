			imageStory : [
				'In-between poetry nights, writing competitions, and running the English Undergraduate Student Association, I learned to analyze the artifacts of popular culture and find where and how a work comes to resonate with its audience. I had the room to experiment and learn how an audienceâ€™s ingrained learning morphs perspective and creates a more complete meaning the designer or artist may never have intended.',
				'I attended Fanshawe to cement my more theoretical learning with a wide variety of skills including web coding, image design, marketing, UI/UX design, and motion design. My natural curiosities led me to explore more and more of visual design, and how its impact extends throughout the experience of the client or end-user. Designing a good experience is my passion.'
